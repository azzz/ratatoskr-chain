# What is ratatoskr-chain?

This is a mythical beast that gnaws blocks of the magical Merkle blockchain tree

This project is where I learn how to build a blockchain with transactions.

**What's not here yet:**
- Here is no wallets system
- Here is no networking

**What's here already:**
- Proof-of-work mining with Hashcash algorithm
- Transactions that yields inputs and produce outputs
- CLI to create transfer money and inspecting the chain
